# Precedence and Associativity

1. Precedence means the priority of operators â€” who should be evaluated first in an expression without parentheses.

2. Associativity decides which direction to go when two operators have the same precedence.
    - If left-to-right, it starts from the left
    - If right-to-lefft, it starts from right

# How to remember which operator have which associativity direction.

```Operator that involve setting  or transforming something (like ==,**,?:) have right-to-left associativity```
