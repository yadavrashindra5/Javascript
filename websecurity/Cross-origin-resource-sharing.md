# What it blocks: Mostly, it blocks JavaScript from reading responses from cross-origin requests. It usually allows actions like clicking links or submitting forms to other origins, but it prevents reading the response data.

1. **_What it is_**: CORS is like a permission slip system. It's a way for a server (the backend where your API lives) to tell the browser: "Okay, I know you usually block requests from different origins, but it's fine for this specific origin to talk to me and read my data."

2. How it works (The Simple Flow):

   1. **_Frontend (Your Webpage's JavaScript)_**: Your JavaScript code (e.g., on https://my-app.com) wants to get data from an API on a different server (e.g., https://api.data.com).
   2. **_Browser's Request_**: When your browser sends this request to https://api.data.com, it automatically adds a special header called Origin: (e.g., Origin: https://my-app.com). This tells the API server where the request is coming from.
   3. **_Backend (API Server's Response)_**: The https://api.data.com server receives the request. If the server wants to allow https://my-app.com to read its data, it will include a special header in its response: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://my-app.com.
   4. **_Browser's Check_**: Your browser receives the API's response. It sees the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header.

   - **_If it matches your website's origin_**: The browser says, "Okay, the server explicitly allowed this. You can read the data." And your JavaScript gets the API's response.
   - **_If it doesn't match (or is missing)_**: The browser says, "Nope! The server didn't give permission, or it explicitly denied it." It then blocks your JavaScript from seeing the API's response, and you'll usually see a "CORS error" in your browser's developer console.

3. **_Who sets Access-Control-Allow-Origin?_** The backend developer (or the person managing the API server). They write code or configure the server to send this header in their API responses. If they don't, your frontend won't be able to access the API data from a different origin.

4. Preflight Requests (For "Complex" API Calls)

   1. **_What it is_**: Sometimes, before your browser sends the real API request, it sends a quick "check-in" request first. This is called a preflight request.
   2. **_When it happens_**: For "complex" requests, like:

   - Using API methods other than just GET or POST (e.g., PUT, DELETE).
   - Sending custom headers (like Authorization tokens or Content-Type: application/json).

   3. How it works:

   1. Browser sends an OPTIONS request: It asks the server, "Hey, I'm about to send a PUT request with a Content-Type: application/json header from my-app.com. Is that okay?"

   1. Server Responds: The server replies with CORS headers indicating what methods and headers are allowed.

   1. Browser Decides:

      - If the server's reply says "Yes, that's fine," then the browser sends the actual API request.

      - If the server's reply says "No, that's not allowed," the browser stops right there and doesn't even send the actual API request. You'll get a CORS error.
